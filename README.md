# Description

The purpose of this final project is to use your newly acquired skills in Artificial Intelligence to to tackle a modestly challenging problem of your choice!  Since time is limited (three weeks), I encourage you to pick SMALL and SIMPLE problems.  Estimate how long it will take you to write your code, then double that.  Then double it a couple more times.  This will provide a suitable *underestimate* of the time involved.  (See Hofstadter's Law).

**Teams:** You may work in self organized teams of up to four using one of two models:

* **cooperative:** everyone works together on the entire codebase, everyone collectively writes the report (in Overleaf-PDF or Markdown).  For groups of size N, this will require approximately 0.8*N times the amount of effort as a single-person project (the 0.2 is due to losses in efficiency due to group dynamics, coordination, etc).

* **competitive:** team works on together on the problem description and a tournament framework, then each team member individually implements their competitor.  A bonus will be given to the best performing agent (when compared to other working solutions).

## Evaluation

Your grade on your final project will be based around the following criteria:

* Scope/Challenge: how hard/interesting is the problem?
* Completion: to what extent did you accomplish what you intended to in your proposal? 
* Implementation: Is your use of AI techniques correct and appropriate?  Is your code well written and clear to understand?
* Assessment/Analysis: How did you measure what you accomplished?
* Utility: a significant bonus will be provided if you can make the case that this project can be converted into a course module for the next CSC320.

## Submit
* git add/push/commit all files needed to compile, alongside
*  Writeup/Analysis: a 5-10 page paper (PDF or `.md`) describing what you did and how you did it, alongside the usual measurement criteria.
*  a "self-grade" scoresheet for the criteria above.
